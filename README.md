## What is Purpose?

I am serving a poll application that is fully free. It has a powerful editor and has a lot of different settings. 

## Demo

If you wonder the project, you can reach it on this web site: http://questionnaire-test.herokuapp.com/

Yes, it's completely slow. Because website, api and database working on free servers.

Website and Api: Heroku
Database: Mongo DB Atlas.


## Api

Api is written on Node.js. That is a very small api. I am not a perfect backend developer, probably it's need more optimization. I used Mongo DB for database.
